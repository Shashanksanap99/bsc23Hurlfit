This week I looked into the Node JS framework.
Node.js is an open source runtime enviroment that allows a developer to run Javascript code on a web browser.
Node contains multiple libraries that allow for the simplification of many Javascript functions.
Node is commonly used to create webservers and APIs meaning its ideal for testing out pages and funtions of our system.
It is for these reasons I've laid out that I recommend we use Node.js when creating our project.
